# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**alejandromumo/alejandromumo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), an open-access digital repository for research data, built to ensure everyone can join Open Science.

ðŸ‘¯ Part of the [InvenioRDM](https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/) community and core developer of the [InvenioRDM framework](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/).

# ðŸ˜Ž Things I built so far

At Zenodo, I worked on multiple features such as:

## European Open Repository Collections

Collections organize the contents of a Zenodo community in logical sets of records. For the European Open Repository, these can be a set of records that share the same funding or are from the same discipline (e.g. `Natural Sciences`).

Have a look at the screenshots:

Each collection can then be accessed to inspect its contents:

These records can be further filtered by using the left-hand facets, providing multiple layers of organization and discoverability of the community contents.

### ðŸ¤“ How it works

The underlying concept of collections is that they are tree-like structures that store an OpenSearch query (to fetch the records). Therefore, we store each collection in the DB as a tree-like structure using the materialized path pattern. Here is a nice guide from the MongoDB folks: 

- [Model Tree Structures with Materialized Paths](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/model-tree-structures-with-materialized-paths/)

If you are curious (and courageous), you can read the [Request for Comments](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/rdm-0079-collections.md) document where all the technical nuts and bolts are discussed.

## Zenodo and Software Heritage integration

Zenodo archives openly disseminated software source code in Software Heritage, in a combined effort to "create an interconnected and interoperable academic ecosystem, (...) contributing to the global software commons" ([blog post](https://blog.zenodo.org/2024/10/21/2024-10-21-swh/))

This means that Zenodo needed to:
- Support software field in its metadata schema
- Integrate with Software Heritage
- Support metadata formats that are suited for the serialization of software-type records

Have a look at some screenshots of this feature:

Zenodo's deposit form supports software-specific fields, including a controlled vocabulary of programming languages.

After a record is archived in Software Heritage, the user can navigate to the archive's landing page.

New export formats were added to support the serialization of software records to common software formats (e.g. `CITATION.cff` and `CodeMeta`)

At the time of this writing, more than 5000 software records have been archived using this integration!
